%description
The Robot Pose EKF package is used to estimate the 3D pose of a robot, based on
(partial) pose measurements coming from different sources. It uses an extended
Kalman filter with a 6D model (3D position and 3D orientation) to combine
measurements from wheel odometry, IMU sensor and visual odometry. The basic idea
is to offer loosely coupled integration with different sensors, where sensor
signals are received as ROS messages.
