%description
This package provides common interfaces for navigation specific robot actions.
Currently, this package provides the BaseGlobalPlanner, BaseLocalPlanner, and
RecoveryBehavior interfaces, which can be used to build actions that can easily
swap their planner, local controller, or recovery behavior for new versions
adhering to the same interface.
