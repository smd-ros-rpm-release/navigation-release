%description
The move_base package provides an implementation of an action (see the actionlib
package) that, given a goal in the world, will attempt to reach it with a mobile
base. The move_base node links together a global and local planner to accomplish
its global navigation task. It supports any global planner adhering to the
nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface specified in the nav_core package and any
local planner adhering to the nav_core::BaseLocalPlanner interface specified in
the nav_core package. The move_base node also maintains two costmaps, one for
the global planner, and one for a local planner (see the costmap_2d package)
that are used to accomplish navigation tasks.
