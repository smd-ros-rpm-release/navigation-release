%description
This package provides an implementation of a 2D costmap that takes in sensor
data from the world, builds a 2D or 3D occupancy grid of the data (depending on
whether a voxel based implementation is used), and inflates costs in a 2D
costmap based on the occupancy grid and a user specified inflation radius. This
package also provides support for map_server based initialization of a costmap,
rolling window based costmaps, and parameter based subscription to and
configuration of sensor topics.
