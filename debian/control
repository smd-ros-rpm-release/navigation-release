Description: This package provides an implementation of the Dynamic Window Approach to local robot navigation on a plane. Given a global plan to follow and a costmap, the local planner produces velocity commands to send to a mobile base. This package supports any robot who's footprint can be represented as a convex polygon or cicrle, and exposes its configuration as ROS parameters that can be set in a launch file. The parameters for this planner are also dynamically reconfigurable. This package's ROS wrapper adheres to the BaseLocalPlanner interface specified in the nav_core package.
